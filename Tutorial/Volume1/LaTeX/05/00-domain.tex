\label{chap_domain}

{\psiboil} currently supports only three-dimensional Cartesian grids.
Three-dimensional grids are represented with the class {\tt Domain}. 
This class holds all the geometric data needed for discretization of 
governing equations, and is built from three one-dimensional grids; each 
one defining discretization in one coordinate direction. These, 
one-dimensional grids, used for building three-dimensional domains
are defined by class {\tt Grid1D}. 

In this chapter, you will learn how to create one-dimensional grids
with the class {\tt Grid1D}, and how to use them to define
three-dimensional domains. 

Furthermore, you will learn about the so-called {\em ravioli}
classes in {\psiboil}, and use two of them: {\tt Range} and
{\tt Periodic}.
