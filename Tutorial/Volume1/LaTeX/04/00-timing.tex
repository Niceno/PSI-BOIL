\label{chap_timing}

Numerical solution of three-dimensional unsteady flow phenomena is 
very CPU-time demanding. Therefore, both developers and users of CFD 
programs are constantly concerned about the efficiency of their programs. 
From user's point of view, the total time needed to resolve a certain
problem is most important, while the developer might be interested in
more detailed information, on efficiency of certain parts of the code,
comparison of different algorithms, suitability for different computer
architectures and alike. 

{\psiboil} provides means to measure both the overall execution time
of the program, and to fine measure parts of the algorithms, whether it
means whole subroutines, or certain programming constructs. These 
time-measurements are performed using the {\psiboil}'s global object
{\tt boil::timer}, briefly introduced in section~\ref{sec_compiling}.
