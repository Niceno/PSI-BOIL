In all figures that follow, {\sf N} is the number of cells specified by the 
user. That is the resolution set in the main function, when creating grids. 

Furthermore, all figures, explanations and code segments consider only 
horizontal direction for the sake of clarity. Other coordinate directions
(vertical which is plotted and normal) are commented via small notes at the 
end of each section.
