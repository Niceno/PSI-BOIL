\section{Node-based variables}
\label{sec:node-based}

In all figures in this section, the reader should focus on violet parts.
Black ones refer to cell-based variables and are kept for reference only.
In the same sense, all occurrences of {\sf n} in text refer to the violet
one (the number of nodes), unless stated otherwise.

Description of Fig.~\ref{node:111}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Number of nodes is greater by one than cells 
        (violet {\sf n} = black {\sf n + 1}) in the vector direction. 
  \item As for cell-based variables, computational nodes are in the range 
        {\sf s} -- {\sf e}, with {\sf s=1} and {\sf e=n-2}.

           periodic boundary condition.}
  \label{node:112}
\end{figure}

Description of Fig.~\ref{node:112}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The node value from first ({\sf s}) and last ({\sf e}) are the 
        {\bf same}, but are computed separately. They are {\bf not} exchanged!
  \item Therefore, it is the second computed column ({\sf s+1}) which is sent 
        to the end buffer~({\sf n-1}), while the column before last computed 
        ({\sf e-1}) is sent to the start buffer~({\sf 0}).
  \item The code from {\tt scalar\_exchange.cpp} to achieve this exchange is:
        \begin{verbatim}
         for_jk(j,k) {
           val[e_x+1][j][k] = val[s_x + o_x][j][k];
           val[s_x-1][j][k] = val[e_x - o_x][j][k];
         }
        \end{verbatim}
        Clearly, {\tt o\_x} (offset) is equal to {\bf one} in this case.

           condition for parallel computation.}
  \label{node:121}
\end{figure}

Description of Fig.~\ref{node:121}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In case of a parallel run, green {\sf n} is the local number of nodes 
        in each processor, including buffers/boundary nodes. 
  \item As for the sequential run with periodic boundary conditions, 
        computational nodes are in the range {\sf s} -- {\sf e} 
        ({\sf 1} -- {\sf n-2}).
  \item As in sequential case, number of nodes is greater than number of cells
        by one: (green {\sf n} = black {\sf n + 1}) in the vector direction.

  \label{node:122}
\end{figure}

Description of Fig.~\ref{node:122}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The node value in the last ({\sf e}) column of the left domain is the
        {\bf same} as the node value in the first computed column of the right 
        domain, but they are computed separately. They are {\bf not} exchanged!
  \item Second computed column ({\sf s+1}) is sent to sending buffer at the start
        of the local domain~({\tt sbuff\_s}) and penultimate computed 
        column~({\sf e-1}) is sent to sending buffer at the end of the 
        domain~({\tt sbuff\_e}).
  \item The code from {\tt scalar\_exchange.cpp} to achieve this exchange is the
        same as for cell-based variable:
        \begin{verbatim}
        for_jk(j,k) {
          int l = k*nj()+j;
          sbuff_e[l] = val[e_x - o_x][j][k];   
          sbuff_s[l] = val[s_x + o_x][j][k];  
          rbuff_e[l] = val[e_x +  1 ][j][k];
          rbuff_s[l] = val[s_x -  1 ][j][k];
        }
        \end{verbatim}
        but {\tt o\_x} (offset) is equal to {\bf one} in this case.

Description of Fig.~\ref{node:211}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Boundary nodes (column {\sf 0} and {\sf n-1}) coincide with the edge of 
        the computational domain. Since columns {\sf 1} and {\sf n-2} are at the
        domain boundaries as well, columns {\sf 0} and {\sf 1} are at the same place 
        on the left edge of computational domain, while columns {\sf n-2} and 
        {\sf n-1} are at same place on the right edge of the domain.
  \item Generally, values at the wall are computed, so computational columns
        range from {\sf 1} -- {\sf n-2}, denoted as {\sf s} and {\sf e}.
