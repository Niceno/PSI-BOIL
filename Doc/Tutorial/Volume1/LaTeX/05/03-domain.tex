\section{Three-dimensional domains}
\label{sec_domains}

As stated before, {\psiboil} supports three-dimensional Cartesian
computational domains, defined by objects of type {\tt Domain}. 
It uses three one-dimensional grids {\tt Grid1D} to define 
resolution in each of the coordinate direction ($x$, $y$ and $z$).

The following program ({\tt 05-04-main.cpp}) creates a cubical domain, 
having dimension $1 \times 1 \times 1$, with uniform cell distribution 
in $x$ and $y$ direction, while stretched towards both ends in $z$ 
direction: 
%
{\small \begin{verbatim}
      1 #include "Include/psi-boil.h"
      2
      3 const real L = 3.2;
      4 const real D = 0.01;
      5 const int  N = 32;
      6
      7 /****************************************************************************/
      8 main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
      9
     10   boil::timer.start();
     11
     12   /* uniform grid */
     13   Grid1D g_uni( Range<real>(-0.5*L, 0.5*L), N, Periodic::no() );
     14
     15   /* stretched grid */
     16   Grid1D g_str( Range<real>(0,L), Range<real>(D,D), N*2, Periodic::no());
     17
     18   /* create domain */
     19   Domain dom(g_uni, g_uni, g_str);
     20
     21   /* plot the domain */
     22   boil::plot = new PlotTEC();
     23   boil::plot->plot(dom, "dom");
     24
     25   boil::timer.stop();
     26   boil::timer.report();
     27 }
\end{verbatim}}
%
Line~13 creates {\tt g\_uni}, a uniform grid with~32 cells, ranging 
from~$\xi=-1.6$ to $\xi=1.6$. Line~16 creates {\tt g\_str}, a grid ranging from 
$\xi=0$ to $\xi=3.2$ which is stretched towards both ends. Note that the size of
cells next to the boundaries of {\tt g\_str} is~$\Delta \xi = 0.01$. 

Command which creates the computational domain is in line~19. This line creates
an object of type~{\tt Domain}, called~{\tt dom}. It's constructor accepts three
arguments: grid in $x$, $y$ and $z$ direction. In this particular case, we use
grid~{\tt g\_uni} for distribution in $x$ and $y$, and grid~{\tt g\_str} to
define distribution in~$z$ direction.

Domain is plotted in lines~21--23. Plotting is performed with the global {\psiboil}
object~{\tt boil::plot}. This global object can be created in two ways, depending
on the format of output files you would like to create. If you would like to plot
your grids (and later results) in Tecplot\footnote{Tecplot is a registered trademark
of Tecplot Inc.\ ({\tt www.tecplot.com})} format,
create the {\tt boil::plot} as in line~22. If you prefer output files in General
Mesh Viewer\footnote{{\tt www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/GMVHome.html}}~(GMV) format, 
change the line~22 to:
%
{\small \begin{verbatim}
     22   boil::plot = new PlotGMV();
\end{verbatim}}
%
When running the program~{\tt 05-04-main.cpp}, you will get the following output:
%
{\small \begin{verbatim}
Domain level 4 created !
Domain level 3 created !
Domain level 2 created !
Domain level 1 created !
# Plotting: dom_p000.dat
+==========================================
| Total execution time: 0.18 [s]
+------------------------------------------
| Time spent in plotting: 0.18 [s]    (100%)
| Time spent elsewhere: 0 [s]    (0%)
+------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}}
%
The output informs you that it has created four grid levels in addition to the
one specified by the user. The level specified by the user is always level~0,
while the coarser levels have larger numbers. Thus, for this particular case,
level~0 will have resolution of:~$32 \times 32 \times 64$, 
level~1: $16 \times 16 \times 32$, level~2: $8 \times 8 \times 16$, 
level~3: $4 \times 4 \times 8$ and, finally, level~4 will have the coarsest 
resolution of only $4 \times 4 \times 4$ cells. 

The grid on the finest level (level~0) is plotted from line~23, using the global
object~{\tt boil::plot} and its member function {\tt boil::plot->plot()}. As the
arguments, you send the {\tt Domain} to be plotted (in this case it is {\tt dom})
and the name you want to associate with it ({\tt "dom"}). The plotting function
({\tt boil::plot->plot()}) names the output file as: {\tt dom\_p000.dat}, where
{\tt \_p000} is processor number and {\tt .dat} is extension recognized by
Tecplot. The grid on the finest level, visualized by Tecplot is shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig_domain_l0}.

  \end{picture}
  \caption{Stretched computational domain.}
  \label{fig_domain_l0}
\end{figure}

Note that program reports on the time spent in plotting functions with:
%
{\small \begin{verbatim}
| Time spent in plotting: 0.18 [s]    (100%)
\end{verbatim}}
%
That is because all the plotting functions are embedded in {\em local} 
timing routines, such as the ones introduced in the section~\ref{sec_local}.

You have to stretch the grid towards the walls very often, but sometimes
you might also want to stretch in the interior - particuluarly if there
are obstacles (or inner walls) inside. A way to achieve such a stretching
is to combine two stretched grids together. The way to do it is demostrated
below. The lines of the {\tt 05-04-main.cpp} code are replaced with the 
following (to get the program {\tt 05-05-main.cpp}):
%
{\small \begin{verbatim}
     15   /* stretched grid */
     16   Grid1D g_str( Range<real>(0,0.5*L), Range<real>(D,D), N, Periodic::no());
     17
     18   Grid1D g_str_2(g_str, g_str, Periodic::no());
     19
     20   /* create domain */
     21   Domain dom(g_uni, g_uni, g_str_2);
\end{verbatim}}
%
{\tt Grid1D g\_str} is still created in line~16, but this time is half
as short and it has half as many cells as in the previous case. Next,
additional grid is created in line~18, where two {\tt g\_str}'s are
added one after another. The {\tt Grid1D} constructor in line~18 
takes two {\tt Grid1D}'s as parameters, leaves the absolute coordinates
of the first intact, but disregards the absolute coordinates of the second.
It shifts and attaches the grid sent as second parameter to the grid sent
as first parameter\footnote{If it was not shifting the second, they
would collapse into one grid for this case.}. 
Finally, {\tt Domain dom} is created in line~21 using the new,
double-stretched grid to set the resolution in~$z$ direction, and
is plotted in~Fig.~\ref{fig_domain_double_stretched}.

      - Three-dimensional Cartesian grids, represent with class {\tt Domain}, 
      are created from three one-dimensional grids ({\tt Grid1D}), with 
      the constructor:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt Domain(Grid1D \& gx, Grid1D \& gy, Grid1D \& gz);}
      \end{itemize}
      where {\tt gx}, {\tt gy} and {\tt gz} represent grid resolutions
      in $x$, $y$ and $z$ coordinate directions. \\
  
      - In order to plot domains, global object {\tt boil::plot} must be 
      defined before it is used. \\
 
      - {\tt boil::plot} can be defined as:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt boil::plot = new PlotGMV();} for plotting with GMV,
        \item {\tt boil::plot = new PlotTEC();} for plotting with Tecplot.
      \end{itemize}

      - Grids ({\tt Grid1D}) can also be constructed by appending one
      after another, using the constructor: 
      {\tt Grid1D(Grid1D \&, Grid1D \&, Periodic)}. \\

      - {\tt Domain}s can be plotted explicitly, using the command:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item {\tt boil::plot->plot(Domain \& dom, "file\_name");}
      \end{itemize}
