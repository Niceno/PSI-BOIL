\label{chap_fields}

Once computational domains are defined~(Sec.~\ref{chap_domain}) the
{\em fields} can be defined as well. Fields are unknown functions  
solved in a numerical simulation, such as: temperature, pressure,
species concentration, velocity fields, and their source terms, as well
as physical properties, or anything else which is defined as a 
variable function over a computational domain. 

As {\psiboil} is based on {\em staggered} FV method, scalar fields   
are computed at cell centers, while vector fields are at the staggered grid, 
placed on the grid cell faces. It is therefore clear that two classes are 
defined in {\psiboil} to represent fields: {\tt Scalar} which holds the
scalar unknown (temperature, pressure, etc.) and {\tt Vector}
which holds velocity components. 

In this chapter, you will learn how to define each of these types
of fields. The most essential thing for each field is the 
domain for which it is defined. Field constructors are therefore
quite simple, the only argument they need is a reference to {\tt Domain}.
