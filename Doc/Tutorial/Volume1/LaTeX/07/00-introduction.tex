\label{chap_transport}

Scalar and vector fields introduced in Sec.~\ref{chap_domain}
can be used to hold transported variables, such as species, enthalpy
and momentum. In {\psiboil}, these fields are embedded into objects
of type {\tt Scalar} and {\tt Vector}, but these objects do not 
have the possibility to discretize and solve transport equations. 

A set of objects which discretizes transport equations is defined
and has a type~{\tt Equation}\footnote{Since it represents a transport equation}.
{\tt Equation} class spawns two {\em children}, namely the {\tt Centered}
for transported scalar fields, and {\tt Staggered} for transported
vector fields. {\tt Centered} class spawns more children, each
specialized for a particular transport equation. {\tt Staggered} class, on the
other hand, has only one child, representing the equation for momentum 
conservation. 

In this chapter, all transport equations implemented in {\psiboil}
are summarized, and enthalpy conservation equation is solved for
a simple problem of steady heat conduction. Although the 
equation solved is simple, it introduces quite a few new
{\psiboil} features, such as linear system solvers, definition 
of materials, etc.
