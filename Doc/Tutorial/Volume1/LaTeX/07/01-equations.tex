\section{Transport equations in {\psiboil}}
\label{sec_equations}

In this section, transport equations currently implemented in {\psiboil} 
are briefly outlined. They all written in {\em conservative} form
because it is closer to physical laws we are trying to simulate and 
because the FV method employed by {\psiboil} discretizes transport
equations in the same form. Furthermore, physical units for
each equation are given, since it serves as a good check whether the
implementation (discretization) of each member in the equation is 
valid. 

\subsection{Species conservation equation}

Species conservation equations, defined with the class {\tt Concentration}, reads:
%
\be
         \int_V \frac{\p \rho \alpha}{\p t} dV
       + \int_S \rho \uvw \alpha \, d{\bf S}
       = \int_S \gamma \nabla \alpha \, d{\bf S}
       + \dot{M}
       \; \; \; \;
       [\frac{kg}{s}]
  \label{eq_species}
\ee
%
where $\rho \; [\frac{kg}{m^3}]$ is the mass density, $\alpha \; [1]$ is the
species concentration, $t \; [s]$ is time, $\uvw \; [\frac{m}{s}]$ is velocity 
field, $\gamma \; [\frac{kg}{ms}]$, and $\dot{M} \; [\frac{kg}{s}]$ is the 
species source. The equation is written in integral form, i.e.\ it is defined
for a general volume $V \; [m^3]$, enclosed by surface $S \; [m^2]$.

Class {\tt Concentration} is derived from {\tt Centered}, which is a derivation
of {\tt Equation}. {\tt Concentration} is defined in 
{\tt PSI-Boil/Src/Equation/Centered/Concentration}.

\subsection{Enthalpy conservation equation}

Enthalpy conservation equations, defined with the class {\tt Enthalpy}, reads:
%
\be
         \int_V \frac{\p \rho C_p T}{\p t} dV
       + \int_S \rho C_p \uvw T \, d{\bf S}
       = \int_S \lambda \nabla T \, d{\bf S}
       + \dot{Q}
       \; \; \; \;
       [\frac{J}{s} = W]
  \label{eq_enthalpy}
\ee
%
where $C_p \; [\frac{J}{kg \, K}]$ is thermal capacity, $T \; [K]$ is the 
temperature, $\lambda \; [\frac{W}{m \, K}]$ the heat conductivity and 
$\dot{Q} \; [\frac{J}{s}]$ is the heat source.

{\tt Enthalpy} is defined in {\tt PSI-Boil/Src/Equation/Centered/Enthalpy}
and is derived from {\tt Centered} and {\tt Equation}.

\subsection{Phase indicator equation}

Phase indicator function ($\Phi$), defined in the class {\tt LevelSet}, is used
in conjunction with conservative Level-Set (LS) method implemented in
{\psiboil}. Essentially, it is purely hyperbolic conservation equation for~$\Phi$:
%
\be
         \int_V \frac{\p \Phi}{\p t} dV
       + \int_S \uvw \Phi \, d{\bf S}
       = 
       0
       \; \; \; \;
       [\frac{m^3}{s}]
\ee

Class {\tt LevelSet} is defined in {\tt PSI-Boil/Src/Equation/Centered/LevelSet}
and has the same ancestry as {\tt Enthalpy} and {\tt Concentration}. {\tt LevelSet}
may be a bit of a misnomer, so it might change it's name in the future.

\subsection{Pressure-Poisson equation}

Not really a transported quantity, but result of the time discretization of
momentum conservation equations, pressure-Poisson equation is defined as:
%
\be
         \int_S \frac{\nabla p'}{\rho} \, d{\bf S} 
       = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_S \uvw \, d{\bf S}
       \; \; \; \; 
       [ \frac{m^3}{s^2} ],
  \label{eq_pressure}
\ee
% 
where $p \; [\frac{kg}{m \, s^2} = Pa]$ is the pressure. As all the other
cell-centered {\tt Equation}s, {\tt Pressure} is derived from {\tt Centered}
and {\tt Equation}. It's definition can be found in:
{\tt PSI-Boil/Src/Equation/Centered/Pressure}.

\subsection{Momentum conservation equation}

The only class belonging to {\tt Staggered} branch of {\tt Equation}s,
is the {\tt Momentum}, which discretizes the momentum conservation 
equation:
%
\be
         \int_V \frac{\p \rho \uvw}{\p t} dV
       + \int_S \rho \uvw \uvw \, dS
       = \int_S \mu \nabla \uvw \, dS
       - \int_V \nabla p \, dV
       + {\bf F}
       \; \; \; \;
       [\frac{kg \, m}{s^2} = N]
  \label{eq_momentum}
\ee
%
Here, $\mu \; [\frac{kg}{m \, s}]$ is dynamic viscosity. 

{\tt Momentum} is the only class derived from {\tt Staggered}, which is
derived from {\tt Equation}. Class {\tt Momentum} is defined in:
{\tt PSI-Boil/Src/Equation/Staggered/Momentum}.
