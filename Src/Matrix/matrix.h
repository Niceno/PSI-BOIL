/***************************************************************************//**
*  \brief Class for storing linear system equation matrices.
*
*  Stores matrices for three-dimensional orthogonal grids using compass
*  notation (w-e, s-n, b-t). Matrices are stored with six diagonals 
*  corresponding to neighboring coefficients, main diagonal and inverse
*  of the diagonal. The class does not offer a lot of functionality, i.e.
*  constructor is the only routine which is really implemented and it
*  merely allocates the memory for the matrix. If it was not for memory
*  allocation, Matrix could have been a structure.
