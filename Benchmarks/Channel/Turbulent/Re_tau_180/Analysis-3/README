I have tried sensitivity on the domain size. 

I have tried the following:

1 - small (default )  8 x 2 x 4 
2 - wide              8 x 2 x 6 
3 - long             12 x 2 x 4 
4 - big              12 x 2 x 6 

40 k time steps were performed, statistics was gathered from 20-40 k.
Time step was 0.015. 

Each had the same cell size in non-dimensional coordinates, meaning that:

1 - small was: 64 x 64 x 64
2 - wide  was: 64 x 64 x 96
3 - long  was: 96 x 64 x 64
4 - big   was: 96 x 64 x 96

The results are virtually the same, as seen in this graphs.    

And they all compare well with Kim's data :-)

Statistics was taken from 20 - 40 k.
