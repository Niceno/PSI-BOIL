This is test I performed for NRG.

I have learned that, only when I perform 80,000 time steps, 60,000 for 
statistics, I managed to get close to Kim's data.

Few parameters:

- Grid: 128 x 128 x 128 cells
- Domain: L x H x W = 8 x 2 x 4
- First cell size: 0.00222222 (0.4 in wall units)
- Distance from the first computational point to the wall 0.00111111 
  (0.2 in wall units)
- First y+ = 0.2
- Density: 1
- Viscosity: 0.000333333
- Pressure drop: 0.00036
- Re_tau = 180.
- Bulk velocity is very close to 1, and
- Time step is 0.015.
- This time step results in the CFL number varying around 0.3. 
- Flow-through time is close to 8.
- I have performed 80,000 time steps, but discarded first 20,000. 
  Hence, the last 60,000 are used for statistics.
- This number of time steps corresponds to a simulation time of 900, 
  which is more than 100 flow-through times.
- Computed Re_tau is 179.917
- Computed u_tau is 0.0599724,
