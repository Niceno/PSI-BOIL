\section{Conservative Form of Governing Equations}

\noindent
The conservative form of governing equations reads:
%
\be
    \frac{\p (\rho \phi)}{\p t} 
  + \nabla ( \rho {\bf u} \phi ) 
  = D + S.
  \label{eq:conservative}
\ee
%
But this is not the form we solve in {\psiboil}. 
It wouldn't work, it would diverge.
We actually solve the following form:
%
\be 
    \rho \frac{\p \phi}{\p t} 
  + \rho \nabla ( {\bf u} \phi ) 
  = D + S,
  \label{eq:nonconservative}
\ee
%
which is not the same as Eq.~\ref{eq:conservative}. It is non-conservative, 
and we need a {\em correction term} to make it conservative. 

\noindent
In order to estimate the correction term, let's develop 
Eq.~\ref{eq:conservative}:
%
\be 
    \rho \frac{\p \phi}{\p t} 
  + \phi \frac{\p \rho}{\p t} 
  + {\bf u} \phi \nabla ( \rho ) 
  + \rho \phi \nabla ( {\bf u} ) 
  + \rho {\bf u} \nabla ( \phi ) 
  = D + S.
  \label{eq:conservative_develop_1}
\ee
%
Note that 3$^{rd}$ and 4$^{th}$ term on the left can be grouped together:
%
\be 
    {\bf u} \phi \nabla ( \rho ) 
  + \rho \phi \nabla ( {\bf u} ) 
  = \phi \nabla(\rho {\bf u}),
  \label{eq:note_1}
\ee
%
and the Eq.~\ref{eq:conservative_develop_1} can be written as:
%
\be 
    \rho \frac{\p \phi}{\p t} 
  + \phi \left[ 
       \frac{\p \rho}{\p t} 
     + \nabla ( \rho {\bf u} )
    \right]
  + \rho {\bf u} \nabla ( \phi ) 
  = D + S.
  \label{eq:conservative_develop_2}
\ee
%
Furhtermore, since mass conservation equation states that:
%
\be 
    \frac{\p \rho}{\p t}  
  + \nabla(\rho {\bf u})
  = 0,
  \label{eq:note_2}
\ee
%
and the Eq.~\ref{eq:conservative_develop_2} reduces to:
%
\be 
    \rho \frac{\p \phi}{\p t} 
  + \rho {\bf u} \nabla ( \phi ) 
  = D + S.
  \label{eq:conservative_develop_3}
\ee
%
The second term on the left can be written as:
%
\be 
    \rho {\bf u} \nabla ( \phi ) 
  = \rho \nabla ( {\bf u} \phi )
  - \rho \phi \nabla ( {\bf u} ),
  \label{eq:note_3}
\ee
%
which, when introduced in Eq.~\ref{eq:conservative_develop_3} gives the final
form of the governing equation:
%
\be 
    \rho \frac{\p \phi}{\p t} 
  + \rho \nabla ( {\bf u} \phi )
  - \rho \phi \nabla ( {\bf u} )
  = D + S,
  \label{eq:conservative_develop_4}
\ee
%
or:
%
\be 
    \rho \frac{\p \phi}{\p t} 
  + \rho \nabla ( {\bf u} \phi )
  = D + S
  + \rho \phi \nabla ( {\bf u} ).
  \label{eq:conservative_final}
\ee
%
The last term is the so-called {\em correction term} and must be added to 
discretization procedure to ensure conservatism.
